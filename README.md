This project takes a previous product catalog app and expands upon it, adding new features and a shopping cart experience. Here's a breakdown:

## What it Does:
 Product Browsing: Users can explore a catalog of products displayed on the homepage, which pulls information from an external source.
 
Detailed Product Views: Clicking on a product reveals a detailed view with all the relevant information.

Shopping Cart: Users can easily add items to their cart and review their selections.

## Key Features:
• Add to Cart: A simple button allows users to add items to their shopping cart.

• Remove from Cart: Users can remove items from their cart if needed.

• Data Fetching: The app dynamically retrieves product data from an external API using the "fetch" method.

• Asynchronous Operations: The app handles asynchronous operations (like fetching data) smoothly using the "async/await" keywords.

• Local Storage: The app uses AsyncStorage to store the contents of the user's shopping cart locally on their device, so it's persistent even when the app closes.

## UI Elements:

• Home: The main screen where products are listed.

• Product Detail: A dedicated view for detailed product information.

• Cart: Displays the items added to the cart.

• Drawer Navigation: A menu that users can access to navigate through different sections of the app.

This project aims to create a user-friendly and functional product catalog app, combining dynamic data retrieval, a shopping cart feature, and local storage to provide a smooth and seamless user experience.

Here are some screenshots of the app
